## Pandas_Mini_Project
Pandas is a powerful Python data analysis tool. It is built in on top of Numpy which makes it faster and efficient. It supports manipulation of data. It has two main data structures, one is Panda Series which is one dimensional array of object and another one is Pandas Dataframe. Pandas can hold different type of data together. This mini project provides the fundamentals of Pandas by analysising the stock data from three different companies.

This mini project is for Udacity Nanodegree Program (https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). Thanks to Udacity for arranging this project to strengthen our knowledge. This project platform has been taken from Udacity.

## Project Motivation
This mini project is for providing a fundamental idea on how to utilize Pandas. It helps to load data from .csv file and manipulate data for further analysis. Stock data have been taken from three different companies - Google, Apple and Amazon. At first, I needed to take care of missing data and then I visualize stock analysis by Matplotlib. This project is a good exercise for Pandas and data visualization.

## Installation
This project needs Anaconda package(Anaconda3), Jupyter Notebook (6.1.4)

## File Description
All stock for for Google, Apple, and Amazon are uploaded as GOOG.csv, APLE.csv and AMZN.csv.
The source code is in Pandas_Mini_project.ipynb
## Discussion
After completing this mini project, I understand how easily we can use Pandas and manipulate data.
